    A bit is the smallest unit, it's either 0 or 1
    1 byte = 1 octet = 8 bits
    1 kB = 1 kilobyte = 1000 bytes = 10^3 bytes
    1 KiB = 1 kibibyte = 1024 bytes = 2^10 bytes
    1 KB = 1 kibibyte OR kilobyte ~= 1024 bytes ~= 2^10 bytes (it usually means 1024 bytes but sometimes it's 1000... ask the sysadmin ;) )
    1 kb = 1 kilobits = 1000 bits (this notation should not be used, as it is very confusing)
    1 ko = 1 kilooctet = 1000 octets = 1000 bytes = 1 kB
    Also Kb seems to be a mix of KB and kb, again it depends on context.
    In linux, a byte (B) is composed by a sequence of bits (b). One byte has 256 possible values.
